Diabetes Classification Project

Project Overview

This project aims to determine whether a person has diabetes based on a binary classification problem. Using a dataset focused on diabetes diagnostics, the notebook explores data preprocessing, feature engineering, and machine learning techniques to build and evaluate predictive models.

Dataset

Name: Diabetes Health Indicators Dataset

Target Variable: Diabetes_binary (1: Diabetes, 0: No Diabetes)

Independent Variables: Features related to health metrics such as glucose levels, blood pressure, BMI, etc.

Objective

The primary goal of this project is to classify individuals as diabetic or non-diabetic using supervised machine learning models. The notebook includes data analysis, model training, hyperparameter tuning, and performance evaluation.

Key Steps in the Project

Data Analysis

Identified and handled outliers and duplicates.

Explored relationships between the target variable and independent variables.

Performed basic feature engineering to improve model accuracy.

Visualization

Used visual tools to understand correlations and feature importance.

Machine Learning Models

Implemented multiple classification models:

Decision Tree

Random Forest

Support Vector Machine (SVM)

Logistic Regression

Gradient Boosting

Evaluated each model's performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

Hyperparameter Tuning

Applied GridSearchCV to optimize parameters for each model and achieve the best performance.

Technologies and Libraries

Python

Jupyter Notebook

pandas, numpy (Data Processing)

matplotlib, seaborn (Visualization)

scikit-learn (Machine Learning)

Results

Models were compared based on their performance metrics.

The best-performing model was selected based on tuned hyperparameters.
